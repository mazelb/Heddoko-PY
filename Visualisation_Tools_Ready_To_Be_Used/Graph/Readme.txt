GraphData will allow you to plot the data contain of any .xlsx or .csv
files (such a file needs a name on the first line of each column) 

You need to put those files in any folder or subfolder reachable from the Document folder.
To plot the data of a file you need to call python followed by the GraphData.py 
(from a Power shell terminal, and from the folder containing the GraphData.py and GraphDataFile.py)
