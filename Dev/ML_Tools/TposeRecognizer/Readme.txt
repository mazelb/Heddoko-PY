To train and use a neural network in order to detect automaticly the Tpose callibration, You have to launch Heddoko_Tpose_Recognizer.py
from a power shell terminal by calling python. The call must be done from the folder containing Heddoko_Tpose_Recongizer.py. The file

Once the signal is observable, you need to select intervalls by choosing the starting point and the end point by clicking in the windows.
Before you need to press a Key (for add) followed by p (for Tpose) n (for non-Tpose). r (remove) will remove the last point selected in the (p or n)
depending if you press r followed by p or n. 

To end the selection of training exemples , you need to press twice e (end) and click in the window.
